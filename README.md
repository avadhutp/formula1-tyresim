Technical Challenges Overcome:
Path Priority Resolution: Resolved conflicts between MSYS2 (UCRT64) Python and CPython 3.14 by implementing shell aliases in .bashrc.

System Configuration: Enabled Windows Long Path Support to accommodate deep dependency trees in the pandas and fastf1 libraries.

Stack Architecture:
Data Scout: Python 3.14 + FastF1 API

Bridge: SQLite3 (to be added)

Physics Engine: C++17 (MSYS2/GCC)

Note: Mathematical curve on the degredation calculator is still linear, updated formula to be added.
